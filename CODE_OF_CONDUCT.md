## LaunchPad üöÄ

LaunchPad generously allows us to use their Huntington, NY location to host our monthly Meetup events. Please remember that LaunchPad is a co-working space. People pay to be there and may be working during our events. 

We ask that you respect these ***6 simple rules**:*

1. Follow the **‚è±**¬†*15 Minute Rule***:** 
    
    Do not enter the building any earlier than 15 minutes before an event starts and do not leave the building any later than 15 minutes after an event ends. You are welcome to continue your conversations outside or at any of the local restaurants or bars.
    
2. Speak at an appropriate level and be mindful of LaunchPad patrons around you.
3. Stay in the open area of the space. This includes our designated meeting area, kitchen area, and front restrooms. 
4. Only sit in the designated seating for our events. Conference rooms, desks, and cubicles are for paid patrons only. 
5. Please be mindful of your appearance and cleanliness, keep your shoes on, and pick up after yourself.
6. Alcohol is not permitted without prior approvals from *both* the Long Island JavaScript event organizer and LaunchPad management.

People violating these rules may be asked to leave the Meetup and/or any future events, including group forums such as Slack. Thanks for helping to keep this a safe and fun space for everyone!
